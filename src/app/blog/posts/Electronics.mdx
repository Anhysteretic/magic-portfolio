In the second unit of Honors Engineering, we learned about electronics and circuits. 

At the start of the unit, we learned about basic electronics; we learned about current, resistance, and voltage compared to a river to visualize:
- Charge = Water  
- Voltage = Height/Pressure Difference  
- Current = Flow of Water
We also learned, Ohm's law where we learned that current is proportional to voltage across two points.

# Series and Parallels circuit

We started with basic circuits, a simple series and parallel circuit which turns on an LED or two. 

## Series circuit
This is an example series circuit that we made. The two LED and the two resistors are in series to each other. This mean that the sum of voltage between the two resistors should be the same as the battery, and also that the current is the same across all components of the circuit because they are in series.

## Parallels circuit
We then made a parallels circuit which means that the two LED-resistor pairs would not be in series to each other. This mean that the current is not the same across all components to the battery. Because each resistor-LED pair is in series to the battery, each channel should have the same sum voltage as the battery. Here is the drawing that we made of the parallels circuit.

Here you can see two resistor-LED pairs here is the circuit wired up on the breadboard:

Each LED is in parallels to each other. 
# Nightlight
We then made a complex circuit. We were asked to make a nightlight, which is a LED that will turn on when it detects that there is an absence of light and turn of when there is light again. We were given the following drawing to base our circuit off of:

It is in this circuit that learned about two new components, the CDS Photoresistor, and the transistor. While the photoresistor might not be commonly used, the transistor is. We learned about how important a transistor is. Here is the transistor that we used:

We took the drawing that we were given and we drew it on the breadboard to visualize it.

We then built it and here is the final result:

# Reflection
Overall this is was a fun unit. I had already had experience with electronics and circuits as I have previous taken a class on this. It was fun to review the basics of electronics. I didn't really struggle with anything except when I had to debug my lightlight due to the wrong transistor. Otherwise it was a fun unit and I spent some time helping classmates when they needed help.
